## Renaming a Column in Matrix in R

I'm brand new to R. In my quest to become fluent in thestatistics aspect of Machine Learning this year, I've ventured toward learning R in all its glory. As a part of that venture, I bumped into how one could actually give names to rows and columns in R's matrix. Cool! 

Here's how to do so:


Fantabuouls! But what if I want to rename the column "Ranipokhari"? You see, Ranipokhari is a major landmark in the Kathmandu Valley. It's virtually in the heart of the city. This, is Ranipokhari:

But I actually find myself in Gahanapokhari, a couple of kilometers up east from Ranipokhari. You must be wondering ... "pokhari" figures in both the localities. What does it actually mean? Pokhari, spelt thus in Nepali:
पोखरी
means a pond, in English. 

Yup! Ranipokhari and Gahanpokhari are both ponds in the Kathmandu Valley. Well ... if you head out to Ranipokhari today, you will not see this:

You will be aghast when you actually see this:

You might ask a passerby where the "pokhari"actually went. At some point after the horrible April 25th earthquake that ravaged much of the country, the "pokhari" part was completely neglected.
